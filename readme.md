# Summary of In Class Project
#### This project can be easily summarized into 3 parts
- Part 1
  - The easy way to outline part one is gaining familiarity with the pandas python library, during this time I found myself figuring pandas out relatively quickly, and as you can see outlined in my work (main.py), the module was very efficient and good
- Part 2
  - This can mostly be outlined by the introduction of the actual machine learning algorithms, namely Gaussian Naive-Bayes methodologies. From here, my program is split into two parts, titanic_problem_preprocessing.py and titanic_problem_bayes.py. The preprocessing file does just that, and the bayes file applies a Gaussian Bayes approach to get accuracies, as shown by you the professor. In my research I did find another method for the Gaussian Bayes which claimed up to a 90 percent accuracy, but I figured you would appreciate me using what you have shown and linking that here https://www.kaggle.com/code/dimitreoliveira/naive-bayes-probabilistic-ml-titanic-survival
- Part 3
  - This approach is similar to part two, however, it also included a Linear SVM approach for higher (but variable) accuracies. During my time writing this, I found it very interesting the variability in a Linear SVM method, and I have decided to research this further.
